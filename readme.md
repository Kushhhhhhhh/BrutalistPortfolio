## 🚀 About This Project

This portfolio isn't just a resume on the web — it's a digital expression of my personality, design choices, and development style.

- 🎨 **Neo-Brutalist meets Soft UI**  
  The interface is inspired by brutalist principles — thick borders, bold layout — softened with gentle color schemes and modern minimalism to make it visually appealing yet different from mainstream templates.

- 🖼️ **Clean UI, Clear Flow**  
  Every section is separated with intention: Projects, Skills, Experience, and Contact — all accessible from a sidebar that's intuitive and screen-friendly.

- 📱 **Fully Responsive & Device-Friendly**  
  Whether it’s on desktop, tablet, or mobile, the layout adapts with ease. Every button, card, and element was tested for comfort and clarity.

- 🧩 **Crafted from Scratch**  
  Built using just HTML, Tailwind CSS, and Vanilla JS — no frameworks or boilerplate generators. Every line is written with love and intent.

- 🔍 **SEO & Performance Focused**  
  With rich meta tags, OG images, schema markup, and blazing-fast load times, the site is built to be discoverable and index-ready.

- 📄 **Downloadable Resume + Live Project Links**  
  Everything a recruiter or collaborator might want is one click away — cleanly placed, easily accessible.

This project is not just about showing skills — it’s about showing thought. From typography to transitions, every part reflects what I value as a developer.
